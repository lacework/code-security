# Lacework Code Security for GitHub Actions

This repository contains a GitHub Action for using Lacework's code security offering on your code. In order for the code in this repository to run, you must be a Lacework customer that has been opted into the beta of our code security program. Please contact Lacework support for more information.

## Usage

### Creating secrets

Before attempting to run this action, you should add three secrets `LW_ACCOUNT_NAME`, `LW_API_KEY` and `LW_API_SECRET` to your GitHub repository (or, better yet, your GitHub organization so they can be shared accross all your repositories). The value for these secrets can be obtained by following the instructions [here](https://docs.lacework.com/console/api-access-keys) to create an API key and then download it.

### On pull requests

To run an analysis on PRs that highlights new alerts, create a file called `.github/workflows/code-analysis-pr.yml` with this content:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

env:
  LW_ACCOUNT_NAME: ${{ secrets._LW_ACCOUNT_NAME }}
  LW_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LW_API_KEY }}
  LW_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.LW_API_SECRET }}
